<Components.Section title="Every Good Idea Starts With a Problem">
    <Components.Paragraph>My freshman year of college, I lived in a dorm hall with heavy doors. My best guess for why they were so heavy is probably due to the high concentration of people and electronics in one building necessitated neccesitated by some fire code. These door also swung in to close automatically if there was nothing holding them open. This trade-off of ease-of-use for safety created a problem: wedge door stops didn't work. Despite our best efforts, the friction created by door stops was no match for the weight of our door. Our temporary solution to this problem was to use another heavy object to prevent the door from closing, that being a brick.</Components.Paragraph>

    <Components.Paragraph>Our idea was simple: rather than wedging a doorstop between the door and the floor, we should create a doorstop that mounts to the floor and hold the door in place through load forces from a spring.</Components.Paragraph>
 
    <Components.Paragraph>This solution had an added benefit as well. The door could be pushed and pulled into the stop without having to bend down. No more wasted effort bending down to wedge a door stop into the door.</Components.Paragraph>
</Components.Section>

<Components.Section title="The Idea">
    <Components.Paragraph>The goal was to keep the design as simple and cheap as possible. Simplicity enables quick iteration and fewer possible points of failure. Reducing the cost of the design would allow us to make many prototypes cheaply. To satisfy our need for simplicity, we decided to design the door stop as a single part. We chose 3D printing as our manufacturing technique because plastic is cheap, allowing us to print a single door stop for less than $1.50. 3D printing also simplifies manufacturing because it enables complex geometry to be printed without the need for complex manufacturing techniques.</Components.Paragraph>
</Components.Section>

<Components.Section title="Compliant Mechanisms">
    <Components.Paragraph>Compliant mechanisms are mechanisms that transfer forces through elastic deformation. In simple terms, they are single-body mechanisms that use bending and flexing rather than motion between bodies to transfer forces.</Components.Paragraph>

    For our design to function properly, we needed a sprint force to be applied to the bottom side of any door. Our idea was to create a "C" shaped bend, in which the bottom half lies parallel to the floor and the top half in angled down in the direction of the incoming door. When the door makes contact with the door stop, it starts to traverse the angled surface. Because the door stop is oriented in such a way that the highest point is farthest from the door, the door needs to exert more force on the door stop as it is pushed in more. There will be a point along the door stop where the normal force on the door stop is just right, so that the door will be held in place by fricitonal forces. Pushing the door in more will be prevented by the door stop's inability to compress more, and pulling the door out will decrease the compressive force holding the door in place, allowing it to swing back into a closed position.

    <Components.Paragraph>All we had to do now was take some measurements, model the thing, and ship it off to print. Our hard work was done. I'm joking of course.</Components.Paragraph>
</Components.Section>

<Components.Section title="Rapid Prototyping">
    Our main challenge was finding the correct length and angle for the spring, and the right surface to optimize friciton.

    <Components.Paragraph>Most ideas don't work on their first try. Lucky for us, we designed and manufactured out door stop in such a way where iteration and manufacturing was quick and cheap. This process was perhaps my first foray into rapid prototyping. For a whole week, I was going back and forth between our dorm room and our campus' 3D printing lab. When classes were over for the day, my schedule was often design, print, test, repeat.</Components.Paragraph>

    <Components.Paragraph>If I recall correctly, we went throug six iterations, and eventually settled on that sixth design. Unfortunately I've lost the picture that shows all of the door stops side-by-side. Most of the redesign process involved finding the correct thickness to achieve the right balance between flexture and fragility. In addition to this, the base because shorter over time when we realized we could save on cost by reducing the use of excess material.</Components.Paragraph>

    <Components.Paragraph>After a while, we were satified. We showed it off to a couple of our friends down the hall. Most of them asked if they could get one for their own room. That's when we realized that we weren't the only one with this problem. We might be able to meet people's needs, make back the $20 or so we spent on this project, and maybe even turn a profit.</Components.Paragraph>

<Components.Section title="Door-to-Door Sales">
    <Components.Paragraph>The good thing about our target market is that it was self-evident. People who keep their doors closed are hard to talk to, but probably don't want a product that keeps their open. People who keep their doors open are easy to talk too, and probably do.</Components.Paragraph>

    <Components.Paragraph>Our dorm hall was divided into three floors with 30 rooms each. Even with a conservative estimate that only one-third of students keep their room doors open, that's still around 30 potential customers. Each door stop cost around $1.50 to produce. If we could sell even 6 door stops at $5 a pop, we could break even. If we could sell to even half of our potential 30 customers, we would make a respectable $30 in profit.</Components.Paragraph>

    <Components.Paragraph>We decided the best way to sell doorstops was to go door-to-door. This had the added benefit of giving any easy way to meet new people, which is always a positive, especially as a freshman student. We also made advertisment posters which we plastered areas of the dorm hall with high foot traffic like main hallways and stairwells.</Components.Paragraph>
</Components.Section>

<Components.Section title="Conclusion">
    <Components.Paragraph>So how many did we sell? Two. In all fairness, we did give away 3 others, however those were to close friends which we didn't charge. The two we sold for a profit of $7 ended up paying for those additional 3, and our capitalist dreams ended with us around $18 in the red.</Components.Paragraph>

    <Components.Paragraph>Fortunately, unlike most entrepreneurial undertakings, our business had extremely low stakes. What was more important was the lessons we learned. It was a lesson in generating solutions to ideas, rapid prototyping, entrepreneurship and marketing.</Components.Paragraph>

    We ended up using our doorstop right until the end of the year when we moved out. Besides the <Components.Paragraph>great practical use that it provided us that year, it was also a constant reminder of...</Components.Paragraph>
