<Components.Title>Parentheses are Good, Actually</Components.Title>

<Components.Paragraph>
    One construct touched on in Programming Languages is the abstract syntax tree (AST). ASTs are essentially a tree of how a language interpreter breaks down a program into smaller components that are evaluated based on their syntax. Racket’s parentheses are highly meaningful, as each pair of parentheses essentially represents a node in an AST, and the separate expressions contained in those parentheses are different branches of the AST. This heavy use of parentheses makes Racket a great metalanguage to implement other programming languages in, as the interpreter for the target language would simply be a recursive Racket function.

<Components.Paragraph>
    Homework five of Programming Languages backs up this claim by having the student create a made-up programming language (aptly named MUPL) with Racket as the metalanguage. As mentioned previously, this homework is deeply fulfilling since it applies many of the cross-lecture concepts taught in Programming Languages and gives a better understanding of interpreters among other things. Racket makes breaking down the interpretation of MUPL into concrete steps easy to follow, as each evaluation is roughly equivalent to wrapping an expression in parentheses. Grossman’s in-depth analysis of Racket’s semantics gave me a much greater appreciation for the programming language than I did before.

<Components.Title>Would I Use Racket?</Components.Title>

<Components.Paragraph>
    I think that Grossman put it most succinctly by saying that:

<Components.BlockQuote>
    “…[one] is entitled to [their] opinion about syntax, but a good historian wouldn’t refuse to study a country where they didn’t like people’s accents."
</Components.BlockQuote>

<Components.Paragraph>
    At the end of the day, a programming language is an interface for writing software, and the choice to use Racket or not would entirely depend on if it were the best tool for the job. I’ve learned that part of being a good computer scientist is exploring technologies outside of your comfort zone to learn new skills, become more knowledgeable, and discover new tools you might actually enjoy using.
