## ðŸ”™ Retrospective
<br />
Part of what makes Harvard's Introduction to Programming with Python so great is Professor David J. Malanâ€™s ability to teach programming concepts clearly and concisely. One problem I have encountered with many teachers is that they assume their students have a certain level of prerequisite knowledge. This prevents the teacher from fully communicating a topic to their students, due to a lack of parity in implicit knowledge between them and their. Malan has the unique ability to approach computer science from the outside perspective of a programming novice, despite his own expert proficiency with computer science. His stress on incremental improvement of code and reliance of building off of previously taught concepts make his lectures easily digestible even from a CS outsider. His high energy ðŸ’¥ and passion during lectures made me more excited to learn programming than I have been in a long time.
<br />
Malan uses Python as a tool to teach programming, not to teach Python. Python is treated as a medium to learn programming concepts, and the language is taught along the way as a side effect. This was a sharp deviation from the Introduction to Programming for Non-Majors course I took at my university. That course tunnel-visioned on the Python language and expected the student to learn programming concepts along the way. CS50 was able to teach me much more than that course could, to a greater effect, despite CS50 being online and asynchronous.

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
<br />
Given my previous experience with programming I did not expect to learn much (I was wrong). I routinely found myself learning new concepts and having gaps in my knowledge filled. For example, I now know the difference between function parameters and arguments (Yes, really). I was genuinely surprised by how much content is crammed into the courseâ€™s 10 lectures (And three mini-lectures). The topics covered are diverse, practical, and foundational for a further education in computer science. Malan starts by teaching basics like variables, conditionals, loops, and functions. The content quickly accelerates to cover APIs, data persistence, regular expressions, and so on. Despite the large selection of topics covered, I never once felt overwhelmed by new information. In addition, the homework felt like an opportunity to put what was learned in class into practice rather than busy work.
<br />
### ðŸ‘Ž Dislikes
<br />
My one, probably unfair, nitpick is that the lectures are not a consistent length. Lectures vary from less than an hour to three hours in length.
<br />
### ðŸ¤” Suggestions for Students
<br />
Donâ€™t be afraid to pause the lectures and go slow. You will learn much more if you code along with Malan during lectures and take notes on important points. Conversely, donâ€™t be afraid to go off the rails and try to predict what Malan will write if you feel confident. One great part of this course is that it encourages you to learn through experimentation.

## ðŸ”‘ *Key Takeaways*
<br />
* Part of good programming is trying to find a balance between compactness and readability.
* Donâ€™t try to write a program all at once. Incremental progress is important for catching bugs in oneâ€™s code and improving it over time.
* Testing code with unit tests is important to confirm that the overall functionality of a function doesnâ€™t change, even if the code inside the function does change.
