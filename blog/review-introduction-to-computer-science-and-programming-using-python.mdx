## ðŸ”™ Retrospective
<br />
MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python has advantages in the fact that the topics it chooses to cover are examined in high detail. Topics that are previously covered in Harvard's CS50 like string manipulation and OOP are broken down from the perspective of a computer scientist rather than just a programmer. This decision to approach problems from both a theoretical and applied perspective allows one to deeply understand each topic, no matter what programming language or implementation is being used. My favorite lectures, by far, were those from Professor Eric Grimson. He has a confident, well-paced lecturing style that I really enjoyed listening to. Unlike Professor Ana Bell's lectures, his lectures tended to cover subject matter that was not covered in CS50.
<br />
### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
<br />
Where this course really shines is its lectures on recursion, data structures, algorithms, and program efficiency. Before this course, I had no experience writing a recursive program. I had heard mentions of recursion in passing and believed that it was more of a stylistic choice for programs that anything else. However, through 6.0001 I learned that the implementation of a program is very important in deciding its efficiency. Choosing to implement an algorithm iteratively or recursively can result in a large difference in the time complexity for a program. I had also heard of order of growth notation in passing, but never really understood it. I now understand its purpose for analyzing the complexity of algorithms in relation to their inputs. This tool will be extremely useful in the future for analyzing my programs' time efficiency.
<br />
I really enjoyed working on the problem sets. Each one was a great way to apply what one had learned up to that point. Each problem set was designed around building a complete and useful program, so that each time I was working towards a concrete goal. The clear, well laid out function skeletons with docstrings meant that I was never confused about how to proceed through a problem, while also leaving the implementation details of a program for myself to figure out.
<br />
### ðŸ‘Ž Dislikes
<br />
In my opinion, 6.0001 was difficult to get into. I attribute part of this difficulty to the fact that the course I took prior to this one, Harvard's CS50, was so great. 6.0001 repeats a lot of the same topics covered in CS50, but with less energy. Dr. Ana Bell, while obviously very knowledgeable of the lecture topics, is not the most engaging teacher in my opinion.
<br />
Additionally, there are very few opportunities during lectures to program along with the professor. This causes the learning to feel very disjointed, as you are digesting a lot of information and not coding during the lectures, and then coding a lot during the problem sets.
<br />
### ðŸ¤” Suggestions for Students
<br />
Like most online courses, take the time to pause or slow down the playback speed of the lecture if you feel that the Professor is talking too fast. I found this especially important for this course since many of the lecture slides were sped through or skipped entirely. I had a tab open on the side with the lecture slides to remedy this. Additionally, be aware that the problem sets (except for problem set 0) will take a long time. I ended up splitting my work on them up over the course of multiple days.

## ðŸ”‘ *Key Takeaways*
<br />
* Computer science and programming are not synonyms.
* It is important to analyze an algorithm separately from its implementation in code, or the machine it is being run on.
* Order of growth, or "Big O", notation measures the *worst case* upper bound on the asymptotic growth of an algorithm in terms of its input.
* Recursion is a useful method for implementing algorithms that has many advantages and disadvantages compared to iteration.
